# Game of Thrones Matching Game

<p> A simple JS matching card game </p>
<p> Hosted at gothousematching.netlify.app </p>

## How It's Made:
<p>Utilized: </p> 
    <ul> 
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>

<p>users are given 15 seconds to make cards, based on Game of Thrones<p/>

## Lessons Learned:
<p>Through building this app, I was able to learn more common algorithms and the setTimeout() web api</p>

## Optimizations
<p>As someone with no background in art, styling could definitely use improvements.</p>
<p>Optimize CSS</p>
<p>Some of the code needs to refactored for better readability. </p>
